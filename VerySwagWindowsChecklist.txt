Windows hardening checklist
Can run script before step 1 if do readme, forensics, and updates first. Follow the order of operations.

**You can update after script if you're trying to stagger, but you need to complete subtext "b" on step 10 first.

Before anything- implement "SecSettingsFinal.inf" by going to Group Policy Editor, and navigating to "Computer Configuration>Policies>Windows Settings"
right-click "security Settings" and hit "import." Import "SecSettingsFinal.inf." This sets up your password policies, etc

1. User management-
	a.delete any users not in readme:
		-Launch "Control Panel", follow path ControlPanel>UserAccounts>ManageAccount
		-cycle through accounts in list that are not needed, clicking account name then "Delete the User"
	b.add any users from readme that aren't already on system:
		-Launch "Settings" go to path Accounts>Family&OtherUsers>AddSomeoneElseToThisPC
		-Go through user configuration "I don't have this person's sign-in info">"Add a user without a Microsoft account">*Enter user info*
	c.alter user roles as needed:
		-from cmd run "mmc"
		-from mmc, go file>Add/RemoveSnap-In>AvailableSnap-Ins>LocalUsersAndGroups>ok
		-select "groups", verify users have the role assigned in the readme
	d.alter user properties as needed:
		-from mmc, click "users", then right click accounts to be changed. Click "properties", then follow below conventions
			~none checked

		
2. set up group policies
	a. review the readme for any groups that need to be created
	b. access the groups menu from the mmc, make sure all users are in the correct groups specified in the readme
		-add or remove users from groups by clicking on the group name
	c.cross-reference default groupt list (Exhibit 1, bottom of doc) with list in groups menu. 
		-review and possibly remove any groups that are not default or specified in the readme by right-clicking and clicking "delete"
		-add groups if needed by right-clicking on blank space in groups menu and clicking "new group"

3. enable windows notificatione
	a. Launch "Windows Action Center" (Win+A) 
	b. click "Manage Notifications". Turn on all notifications. (They're on if you can't do this.)

4. configure User Access Control

	b. on left-hand side, raise bar to "Always Notify".


5. software to be installed and configured
	a. MalwareBytes
	b. Avast AntiRootkit
	c. use "Everything" from "voidtools.com" to search for files from "SuspiciousFiles" directory
	d. use "Revo Uninstaller" from "www.revouninstaller.com" to thoroughly remove anything other than CyberPatriot items not EXPLICITLY required in readme. (Use advanced remove for anything inherently malicious)

6. Process check
	a. run "netstat -anb 5"('o' apendage will show PID) and check for unusual output//port numbers. Double-check listening ports are req'd. (MAKE SURE YOU STOP PROCESS AND BLOCK PORT IN FIREWALL)
	b. run "tasklist", same process.
	c. "netstat" -ano -p *protocolname* 5" can search tasks by protocol, can be used in conjunction with readme data
	d. you can use the task manager to sort tasks by memory usage
	e. use "www.processlibrary.com" to determine if processes are legitimate.

7. Patch management/misc
	a. use the tool found at "ninite.com" to manage patches for selected programs
	b. run "sfc /scannow" from cmd to check for bad windows files	

8. Configure internet options
	a. search "Internet Options" and start
	b. navigate to "Advanced" tab. Click "Reset" under "Reset Internet Explorer settings"

9. configure file settings
	a. search and launch "folder options", go to "view" tab
	b.  Show hidden files, folders, and drives should be checked and Hide extensions for known file types should be unchecked... this can help with cleanup if points are still missing
	c. remove unwanted file types from system

10. misc
	a. review task scheduler
	b. check for scripts that run on boot. 
		-run Gpedit.msc>Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Scripts and check for scripts
	c. check known network connections/adapters
	d. check firewall exceptions
	e. check certs through certmgr.msc

	a. update machine
	b. install microsoft service packs. Can be found through google.
		
		

Notes/If Stuck:
		
-If lost, cross-reference categories you've earned points in with vulnerability categories from previous seasons to form an idea of what you're missing. Adam can get them for you.
-Look at resource usage in task manager
-make sure no accounts are "password never expires"
-check ipsec policies
-check for an applocker config
